# X Lang Package!

This is a project containing a bunch of files, this isn't made 100% by me, it's like 70% by me, because I followed a tutorial that teaches how to make your own editor

## List of things
- A text editor (Slimin)
- A Programming Language (Xlang)
- The source code of the text editor

### Warning:
You will notice that the editor file is "xeditor.exe" but in the "title screen" it says "Slimin Editor" it was a compiling error because I forgot to change the name
